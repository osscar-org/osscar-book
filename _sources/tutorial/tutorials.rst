Prior to development, it is necessary to have Python installed alongside a Jupyter environment. We recommend the usage of JupyterLab, which has a superior GUI than a standard Jupyter notebook.
Read more about JupyterLab by following the link below:

- :doc:`Programming environment: JupyterLab <./jupyterlab>`

In the OSSCAR project, we rely primarily on Jupyter widgets for interactivity. It is crucial to know how to implement these widgets in your notebooks. 

- :doc:`Use widgets <./widgets>`

After understanding the usage of widgets, it is time to prepare the
notebook. Here we give two examples that shall help you understand how we prepare
the notebooks.

- :doc:`Interactive trigonometric functions <./trigonometric_functions>`

The following is a more complex example which has particular relevance to the fields of computational chemistry and physics.

- :doc:`A molecular visualizer with interactive periodic table <./osscar_widgets>`

After preparing the notebooks, we use the program Voila to convert them into web applications. We also outline three different deployment methods
for the web applications.

- :doc:`Voila: convert notebooks into web applications <./voila>`

If you wish to develop notebooks specifically for the OSSCAR project, you may read more about how to do so in the "how to contribute" page.

- :doc:`Tutorial on how to contribute a new notebook to OSSCAR. <../code/contributing>`

Specifically, you may wish to download the example template notebook which contains an outline of the standardized notebook format employed in OSSCAR along with a discussion of the motivation for these design choices.

- :doc:`Example template notebook. <../code/sample_notebook>`
