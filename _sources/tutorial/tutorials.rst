Before the developement, you need have Python with Jupyter envoironement.  We
suggested to use JupyterLab, which has better GUI than the Jupyter notebook.
Read more about JupyterLab by the link below:

- :doc:`Programming envoironement: JupyterLab <./jupyterlab>`

In the OSSCAR project, we are mainly relying on Jupyter widgets for the
interaction. It is curical to know how to use the widgets in the notebooks. 

- :doc:`Use widgets <./widgets>`

After understanding the usage of the widgets, it is time to prepare the
notebook. Here, we gave two examples, which helps you understand how we prepare
the notebooks.

- :doc:`Interactive trigonometric functions <./trigonometric_functions>`

Here, we are giving another example, which is more complex example. And this
example is related to computational chemistry and physics.

- :doc:`A molecular visualizer with interactive periodic table <./osscar_widgets>`

After preparing the notebooks, we use the program Voila to convert the Jupyter
notebooks into web applications. We also give three different deployment methods
for the web applications.

- :doc:`Voila: convert notebooks into web applications <./voila>`
