.. The OSSCAR (Open Software Services for Classrooms and Research) platform is a
.. collaborative environment targeted at enhancing awareness and adoption of best
.. practises in Open Science.

.. OSSCAR targets both research and education: it provides some of the core tools
.. needed for “computational thinking”, first targeting physics, chemistry,
.. materials science, mechanical and chemical engineering. 

.. OSSCAR develops original educational content, offered exploiting the
.. infrastructural resources developed for the `Materials Cloud`_, and disseminated
.. widely through the `CECAM`_ network and beyond.

.. OSSCAR started in 2019 and is funded by the EPFL Open Science Fund until 2022.

We developed interactive web applications for quantum mechanics and
computational materials science education. The web applications (e.g. shown in
the animation below) demonstrate knowledge through high-quality interactive
visualization.

Our web applications are converted from Jupyter notebooks, which are popular for
educational purposes among the science community. Our technologies are reuseable
and we encourage teachers and students to develop their educational web
applications with OSSCAR technologies.
