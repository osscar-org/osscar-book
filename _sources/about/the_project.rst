OSSCAR (Open Software Services for Classrooms and Research) provides an open-science online hub in the form of an open and collaborative platform to host software, simulation and data-analysis tools, geared towards education and research. 

You can watch a 2-minute introduction to the project in the following video.

Tools are provided as web applications, generated from Jupyter notebooks. This facilitates access to educational functionality either directly or wrapped around existing open-source simulation codes. Implementing Software-as-a-Service tools alongside interactive Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) engenders easy development and deployment (for researchers and classroom instructors), and interaction (for students).

OSSCAR’s goal is to become a support tool for a diverse range of computational classes and research areas, both in terms of content and of easy-to-deploy models.
