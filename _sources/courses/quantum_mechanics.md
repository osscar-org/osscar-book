This notebook solves numerically the quantum-mechanical problem of a single
rectangular one-dimensional quantum well, and displays interactively the
eigenfunctions (plotted at the height of the corresponding eigenvalues).

This notebook displays interactively the eigenfunctions for double square well
potential (DSWP) in one dimension, as obtained from the numerical solution.  The
double square well potential model is a simple but efficient way to describe
real molecular or material systems.

## 3. [Avoided Crossing in One Dimensional Asymmetric Quantum Well](https://github.com/osscar-org/quantum-mechanics/blob/develop/notebook/quantum-mechanics/asymmetricwell.ipynb)

We demonstrate the avoided crossing phenomenon by solving the Shrödinger
equation of a one-dimensional asymmetric quantum well.

## 4. [Shooting Method with Numerov Algorithm to Solve the Time Independent Schrödinger Equation for 1D Quantum Well](https://github.com/osscar-org/quantum-mechanics/blob/develop/notebook/quantum-mechancis/shooting_method.ipynb)

The main goal of this notebook is to demonstrate the shooting method with the
Numerov algorithm to search the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a 1D quantum
well.

## 5. [Numerical Solution of 1D Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation by Split Operator Fourier Transform (SOFT) Method](https://github.com/osscar-org/quantum-mechanics/blob/develop/notebook/quantum-mechanics/soft.ipynb)

We presented the split operator Fourier transform (SOFT) numerical method to
solve the one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation with various
potentials.
