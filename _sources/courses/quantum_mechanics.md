# **Quantum Mechanics**

Quantum mechanics is the core of modern physics and chemistry. Computational
physics and chemistry are predominantly involved in implementing computer
algorithms of quantum mechanics calculations to simulate molecular and material
systems.

Here, we developed several web applications to demonstrate the fundamental
concepts and knowledge in quantum mechanics. We focused on the numerical methods
to solve simple potential systems.

This notebook solves numerically the quantum-mechanical problem of a single
rectangular one-dimensional quantum well, and displays interactively the
eigenfunctions (plotted at the height of the corresponding eigenvalues).

This notebook displays interactively the eigenfunctions for double square well
potential (DSWP) in one dimension, as obtained from the numerical solution.  The
double square well potential model is a simple but efficient way to describe
real molecular or material systems.

We demonstrate the avoided crossing phenomenon by solving the Shrödinger
