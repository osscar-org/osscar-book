This notebook shows interactively how discrete Fourier series can represent a
function with a limited amout of plane-wave components. This notebook focuses on
a simple example (much simpler than a complete DFT calculation) in order to help
the reader focus on the essential aspects of such a representation.

The main goal of this notebook is demonstrating the band structures and density
of states for free-electron model in a periodic lattice.

This notebook demonstrates various approaches for the numerical calculation of
the density of states (DOS) for a 3D free-electron model in periodic boundary
conditions.

## 4. [Norm-conserving Pseudopotentials](https://github.com/osscar-org/quantum-mechanics/blob/develop/notebook/band-theory/pseudopotential.ipynb)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/osscar-org/quantum-mechanics/develop?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fnotebook%2Fband-theory%2Fpseudopotential.ipynb)

Pseudopotential is a technique to construct an effective potential that includes
both the effects of the nucleus and of the core electrons, allowing to consider
explicitly only the valence electrons. This notebook shows a method to construct
norm-conserving pseudopotentials and to display them interactively, together
with the resulting pseudowavefunctions.
