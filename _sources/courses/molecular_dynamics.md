In classical molecular dynamics simulations, molecular motions are
computed via Newton's equations. A numerical approximation is
employed to affect this propagation on a computer. In this approximation, velocities of the atoms are treated as constant during a tiny time
period Î”t. A numerical algorithm called Verlet integration is employed to update
the positions, velocities and accelerations of the simulated system. Here, we
consider a two-body system (sun and earth) to demonstrate this numerical method.
