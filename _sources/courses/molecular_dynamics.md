In the classic molecular dynamics simulations, the molecular motions are
computed by solving the Newton equation. The numerical approximation is
employed, which treats the velocities of the atoms as constant during a tiny
period Î”t. A numerical aglorithm called verlet integration is employed to update
the positions, velocities and accelerations of the simulated systems. Here, we
used a two-body system (sun and earth) to demonstrate this numerical method.
