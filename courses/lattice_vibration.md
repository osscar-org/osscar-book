This notebook introduces the concept of lattice vibration and their
corresponding quanta of vibrational energy, the phonons. Phonon are at the heart
of thermal properties of crystals such as heat capacity, thermal conduction,
etc. The concept of dispersion relation, Brillouin zone and effect of diatomic
lattice are discussed in *duo* with the interactive visualizer.

This notebook extends the notion of phonons to the 2D case. In this notebook,
the link between the reciprocal space and the band dispersion plot along certain
path is made explicit. The wave can now be transversal as opposed to
longitudinal only in the 1D phonon case. A simple example, the square lattice,
and a more complex one, the honeycomb lattice, are presented.

With this notebook, the concept of molecular vibration is explored and
visualized in an interactive fashion.
