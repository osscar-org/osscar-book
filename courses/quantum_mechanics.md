# **Quantum Mechanics**

Quantum mechanics is one of the pillars of modern physics and chemistry. A large amount of the work carried out in computational physics and chemistry is concerned with the implementation of computer algorithms to perform quantum mechanical calculations with the goal of simulating molecular and material systems.

Here, we present a collection of web applications which demonstrate fundamental
concepts underpinning quantum theory. Focus has been given to numerical methods employed in the solution of the time independent and dependent Schrödinger equation for systems in the presence of simple potentials.

This notebook solves numerically the quantum-mechanical problem of a single
rectangular one-dimensional quantum well, and displays interactively the
eigenfunctions (plotted at the height of the corresponding eigenvalues).

This notebook displays interactively the eigenfunctions for the double square well
potential (DSWP) in one dimension, as obtained from the numerical solution of the associated time-independent Schrödinger equation.  The
double square well potential model is a simple but efficient way to describe
real molecular or material systems.

We demonstrate the phenomenon of avoided crossing by solving the Shrödinger
