How to contribute
##############################

It is our goal, within the OSSCAR project, to foster a community in which novel interactive, educational content is developed and shared in a manner which reflects the fundamental principles of open science (a nice summary of these principles is given at the following page http://openscienceasap.org/open-science/).

If you wish to contribute a notebook, the easiest way to proceed is to open a pull request on the main repository. 

The first step is to create a personal fork of the osscar-org/quantum-mechanics repository. 

After having forked the main OSSCAR repo, you can then clone your fork. To do so, navigate to the desired directory on your local machine and run 
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quantum-mechanics.git

Then you can develop your notebook in the appropriate section. For now, only notebooks falling within the existing categories (band theory, quantum mechanics, etc.) are those that shall be accepted as contributions to the project. 

Ideally, prior to opening a pull request, you should format the notebook so as to adhere to the standardised structure which has been implemented in the existing notebooks (sub-sections for goals, tasks and solutions, a visualization section and legend). Information and guidance is provided in a `sample notebook <./sample_notebook.html>`_ on how to create a notebook with this structure. The design choices for this standardized notebook template were made so as to simultaneously maximize the notebooks' educational efficacy whilst observing the guiding principles of open science).

After doing this, go ahead and open a PR and we shall review your notebook and iterate until it is ready to be published. 

If you have any other questions regarding contribution of content don't hesitate to contact a member of `the team <../about/team.html>`_.
