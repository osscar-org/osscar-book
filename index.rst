Welcome to OSSCAR's documentation!
###################################

The OSSCAR (Open Software Services for Classrooms and Research) platform is a
collaborative environment targeted at enhancing awareness and adoption of best
practises in Open Science.

OSSCAR targets both research and education: it provides some of the core tools
needed for “computational thinking”, first targeting physics, chemistry,
materials science, mechanical and chemical engineering. 

OSSCAR develops original educational content, offered exploiting the
infrastructural resources developed for the `Materials Cloud`_, and disseminated
widely through the `CECAM`_ network and beyond.

OSSCAR started in 2019 and is funded by the EPFL Open Science Fund until 2022.
