The OSSCAR (Open Software Services for Classrooms and Research) platform is a collaborative environment targeted at enhancing awareness and adoption of best practises in Open Science and computational thinking, focusing on education and research. 

OSSCAR develops original educational content such as the pedagogical web application demonstrated in the animation below. This content is offered by exploiting the
infrastructural resources developed for `Materials Cloud <https://www.materialscloud.org>`_, and disseminated
widely through the `CECAM`_ network and beyond.
