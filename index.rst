The OSSCAR (Open Software Services for Classrooms and Research) platform is a collaborative environment targeted at enhancing awareness and adoption of best practises in Open Science.

OSSCAR targets both research and education: it provides some of the core tools
needed for “computational thinking”, first targeting physics, chemistry,
materials science, mechanical and chemical engineering. 

OSSCAR develops original educational content such as the pedagogical web application demonstrated in the animation below. This content is offered by exploiting the
infrastructural resources developed for `Materials Cloud <https://www.materialscloud.org>`_, and disseminated
widely through the `CECAM`_ network and beyond.
